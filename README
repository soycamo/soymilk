soycow.org lyrics database
now with more rails!

Language key:
en_US - American english (my default. since I am american.)
es_MX - Mexican spanish (some approximation thereof)
ja_JP - japanese
ja_US - my proposed internal key for Romanized Japanese.
en_JP - the other proposed internal key for romaji.

I might just have them be interchangeable since I am like the only
person who will be committing to this. potentially other people could
adapt this db system as well, but... they can make the shots. maybe
it will be a preference in the nonexistant preferences.

whoa ho. whoa way ho

love,
camo.
