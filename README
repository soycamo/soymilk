soycow.org lyrics database
now with more rails! three of them!!!

Currently, this project is still underway. Background:
I used to be a translator for mognet.net but always thought
the system being used was not so great so now that I am
better at programming than I was at 16, I am writing this
app for my younger self. This also means that all my
unpublished translations will be sent forth to the world.
After becoming a huge fan of Anita Tijoux, I realized
other people might want to know what she is singing.
Actually, I missed the thrill of lyrics translation.

Language key:
en_US - American english (my default. since I am american.)
es_MX - Mexican spanish (some approximation thereof)
ja_JP - japanese
ja_US - my proposed internal key for Romanized Japanese.
en_JP - the other proposed internal key for romaji.

I might just have them be interchangeable since I am like the only
person who will be committing to this. potentially other people could
adapt this db system as well, but... they can make the shots. maybe
it will be a preference in the nonexistant preferences.

whoa ho. whoa way ho. waaaay ho.

love,
camo.
